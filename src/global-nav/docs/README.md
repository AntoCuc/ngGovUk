To include the header add the directive by using the data attribute <code>data-global-nav</code> in the mark up.

In the javascript create an object called <code>globalNav</code> which can contain two objects: <code>pageTitle</code> and <code>navItems</code>. If your page does not require either of those, they can simply be omitted.
